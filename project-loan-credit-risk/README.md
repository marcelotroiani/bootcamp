# Loan Credit Risk

## Background

When a financial institution examines a request for a loan, it is crucial to assess the risk of default to determine whether to grant it. This solution is based on simulated data for a small personal loan financial institution, containing the borrower's financial history as well as information about the requested loan. Several different prediction techniques were tested and results compared. A simple flask app was also created to give the predictions based on any user inputs.
